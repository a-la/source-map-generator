The package is available by importing its default function:

```

## `class SourceMapGenerator`

An instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being built incrementally.

**Removed Methods For Now**

- [x] `static fromSourceMap`
- [x] `applySourceMap`


```### constructor => SourceMapGenerator
[
  ["conf", "Config"]
]
```

The constructor method is called to create a new source map.
